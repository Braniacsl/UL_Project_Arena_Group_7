# FYP Project Showcase & Voting Portal

Each year, CSIS final-year students complete significant amount of projects (FYPs), producing reports, videos, and demonstrations that represent the culmination of their degree work. Currently, the submission, review, and showcase processes are fragmented — students upload files to shared drives or email supervisors, and the public exhibition of projects is limited to an in person event. This results in poor discoverability of past work and inconsistent proof of submission for grading and archiving purposes.
The FYP Project Showcase & Voting Portal aims to create a centralized, secure, and public-facing repository where students can upload their final project files (PDF report, abstract, and recorded presentation video) and receive automated confirmation once the submission is complete. The system will the FYP admin to control which projects are released publicly through a whitelisting mechanism, ensuring sensitive or pending work remains private. Logged-in users can browse, and view released projects, filter by year, cohort, supervisor, or keyword, and registered users can vote for their favorite entries. During the current showcase period, all users (including visitors) can view project abstracts, videos, and leave comments. Over time, this portal will serve as both an official submission platform and an evolving archive of CSIS graduation projects.
